In this updated version, the user is able to enter multiple recipes in the system.
The system asks ingredients of the recipe, units, measurements, food group and calories of the ingredients.
The system stores the recipes and allows the user to view them as entered alphabetically.
The user is also able to search up a recipe in the system by using the name.
If the reecipe that the user has opted for surpasses 300 calories, the system warns the user.
If the user runs the system and would like to close it, there is an option to do that.
